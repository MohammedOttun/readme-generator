## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. The README should answer these questions:
- What the app is for?
- How to use the app? 
- How to install it?
- How to report issues?
- How to make contributions?

This applications is a command-line application that is used to generate a README file. This will provide the developer more time to focus on development, rather than docummentation.

**README Generator** will dynamically generate a `README.md` file, based on user input from the command-line.
User input will be collected using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) is the guide for a high-quality, professional README file. 


## How to use:
- The application will be invoked by using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

- [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sdx9zgi6VbBwheL60Dp-bBk9GUWF_VLi/view?usp=sharing) that demonstrates its functionality.
